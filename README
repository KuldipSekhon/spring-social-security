Many applications using Spring Security for authentication will need to:

    Ask users to sign up using a username and password.
    Create their own user details store and data access objects
    Provide account management (eg. forgotten password functionality)
    Provide access control for protected resources

For applications which already use spring-social to connect with external authenticated apis (eg. Facebook, Twitter) , SocialSignIn’s spring-social-security module removes these authentication concerns by delegating authentication in Spring Security via spring-social to the third party api. Authenticating your website users via spring-social api providers means:

    No need for users to remember another password for another site.
    No need for developers to create their own user details store, as the store used by spring-social is used instead.
    No need for developers to provide account management as this is provided by the third party api.
    SpringSocialSecurity can be easily customised to delegate access control decisions to third party api
